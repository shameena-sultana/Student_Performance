A beginner-friendly SQL project to analyze student performance using simple queries and real-world logic.

## 👨‍🎓 My Dataset

Tables:

2. Run `data/insert_data.sql` to insert sample data
3. Use `queries/*.sql` to perform analysis

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Table relationships and joins
- Aggregate functions like `AVG()` and `MAX()`
- Real-world data logic for education
